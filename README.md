# The-Spark-Foundation---Task-Supervied-ML

**Introduction** - In this project, we aim to predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based on the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task involving two variables: hours studied and percentage score.

**Problem Statement** - Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs./day?

**Dataset** - http://bit.ly/w-data

**Getting Started** - To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

**Usage** -
- Import the necessary libraries.
- Read the data from the provided dataset.
- Visualize the distribution of scores.
- Prepare the data by dividing it into attributes (inputs) and labels (outputs).
- Split the data into training and test sets.
- Train the algorithm using linear regression.
- Plot the regression line.
- Make predictions using the trained model.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error.

**Example** - Suppose a student studies for 9.25 hours/day. The predicted score for this student would be approximately 93.69%.

**Conclusion** - Based on the analysis and predictions made, it is evident that there exists a positive linear relationship between the number of hours studied and the percentage of marks scored by the students.

**Credits** - This project is part of the internship program by The Spark Foundation.
